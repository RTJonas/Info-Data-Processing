The model development cycle goes through various stages, starting from data collection to model building. Most of us admit that data
exploration needs more attention to unleashing the hidden story of data but before exploring the data to understand relationships (in
variables), It’s always recommended to perform hypothesis generation. (To know more about hypothesis generation, refer to this link

It is important that you spend time thinking about the given problem and gaining the domain knowledge. So, how does it help?

This practice usually helps in building better features later on, which are not biased by the data available in the dataset. This is a
crucial step which usually improves a model’s accuracy.

At this stage, you are expected to apply structured thinking to the problem i.e. a thinking process which takes into consideration all the
possible aspects of a particular problem.
