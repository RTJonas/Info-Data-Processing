Prediction and submission to DataHack
To upload a submission to DataHack, you need to predict the loan approval rate for the observations in the test set. This can be done
using ".predict()" method with logistic regression object (model). To extract the test features we will need to create a numpy array of
input features of test data set in the same way as we did when training the model for training data.

Next, you need to make sure your output is in line with the submission requirements of DataHack: a csv file with exactly 367 entries and
two columns: LoanID and LoanStatus. Then create a csv file using to_csv() method from Pandas.

Example:

#test_modified already loaded in the workspace

# Select three predictors Credit_History, Education and Gender
predictors =['Credit_History','Education','Gender']

# Converting predictors and outcome to numpy array
x_test = test_modified[predictors].values

#Predict Output
predicted= model.predict(x_test)

#Reverse encoding for predicted outcome
predicted = number.inverse_transform(predicted)

#Store it to test dataset
test_modified['Loan_Status']=predicted

#Output file to make submission
test_modified.to_csv("Submission1.csv",columns=['Loan_ID','Loan_Status'])
